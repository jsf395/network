# network
Put all your python code in a separate branch of your name.

Please download Python 2.~ that supports socket programming.

Please look at Troy's command table and dataframe excel sheet in the Network Google Drive folder. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzP48xF_1eIUSFBCbWt2YmtzTzA
- Assignments:
  - 1 (1 week): Understand and study the python socket programming of TCP and UDP. https://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html. Try re-coding their sample code at the bottom of the page. If you're familiar with python socket programming already, please then move onto assignment 2.
  
    Search how to connect Python to Arduino attached with Wifly. http://niltoid.com/blog/arduino-talks-to-python/ as example
  - 2 (2 weeks): Program the UDP heartbeat dataframe and create a bind between client and server.
  
    Please talk to Troy if you have any questions on doing this.
  - 3 (x weeks): Parser for translating bit to Arduino C code. (Will probably be C coding)
  - Testings when everything is finished.
